I ran "./testdominion.out 8" with both my dominion.c and johnsdea's dominion.c and did a "git diff gameResults_rettigs.out gameResults_johnsdea.out" to see the differences.

I ended up finding a divergence on line 65 of the output file, where his version purchases a Smithy when mine purchased a Curse.  My version attempted to purchase a Smithy, but the action failed.  This may likely be due to the bug in the Smithy code I added for assignment 1 that is still present in my dominion.c code.  After the initial divergence, the effects seem to compound, causing even more differences between the two executions.  In the end, all players end up having drastically different scores, and even a different player wins.  I am not surprised with how big the divergence got, because not only did the divergence happen fairly early in the game, allowing it to compound more, but I also still had a bug in my adventurer card as well, and we even had differing discard functions too.
